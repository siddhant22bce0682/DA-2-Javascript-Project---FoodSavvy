  <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
  <p>Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutritious foods is essential for maintaining good health. Here are some tips to help you make healthier food choices:</p>
  <div class="tips-container">
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>1. Eat Plenty of Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
      <p>Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help protect against diseases. Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>2. Choose Whole Grains</h3>
      <p>Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread, are high in fiber and nutrients. They can help improve digestion and lower the risk of chronic diseases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>3. Include Lean Protein Sources</h3>
      <p>Opt for lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, tofu, beans, and legumes. These foods are lower in saturated fat and can help support muscle growth and repair.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>4. Limit Processed Foods and Sugary Drinks</h3>
      <p>Avoid processed foods high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Instead, choose whole, minimally processed foods. Opt for water, herbal tea, or homemade smoothies instead of sugary drinks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>5. Stay Hydrated</h3>
      <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Water is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall health. Limit consumption of sugary beverages and alcohol.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>6. Practice Portion Control</h3>
      <p>Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates, bowls, and utensils to help control portion sizes. Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>7. Cook at Home More Often</h3>
      <p>Preparing meals at home allows you to have better control over ingredients and cooking methods. Experiment with healthy recipes and try incorporating new ingredients into your meals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <h3>8. Be Mindful of Snacking</h3>
      <p>Choose nutritious snacks such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and yogurt. Avoid mindless snacking and emotional eating. Listen to your body's hunger cues and eat when you're truly hungry.</p>
